# Machine Learning

This repo contains course work for the Summer 2019 semester of GWU's Machine Learning class. The group worked together to enter two kaggle competitions: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer" rel="nofollow">Digit Recognizer</a> and House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques.

## Digit Recognizer

The<a href= "https://github.com/britcbish/dsnc6290-coursework/blob/master/MNIST.ipynb" rel = "nofollow"> jupyter notebook</a> that we submitted for this competition is commented through and speaks to our methods. We use a convolutional neural network and data augmentation for a submission score of .99571 - this placed us at 485/3046 on the leaderboard at the time of our submission.
